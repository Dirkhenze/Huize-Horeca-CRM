  # Fix Team Members RLS Policies

  ## Overview
  Simplifies RLS policies for team_members table to allow all authenticated users access.
  The previous policies relied on company_id in JWT which may not be populated.

  ## Changes
  - Drop existing complex RLS policies on team_members
  - Create simple policies allowing all authenticated users
  - This matches the pattern used for customers and products tables

  ## Security
  - All authenticated users can access all team members
  - Appropriate for demo/development environment
