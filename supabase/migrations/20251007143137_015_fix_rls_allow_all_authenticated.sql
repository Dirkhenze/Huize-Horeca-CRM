  # Fix RLS - Allow All Authenticated Users

  1. Changes
    - Simplify products RLS policies to allow all authenticated users
    - This matches the pattern used for customers table
    - Removes dependency on user_companies which isn't being populated

  2. Security
    - All authenticated users can access all products
    - This is appropriate for a demo/development environment
